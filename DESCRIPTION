Description: A comprehensive reproducibility framework designed for R and bioinformatics
    workflows. Automatically captures the entire analysis environment including R session
    info, package versions, external tool versions (Samtools, STAR, BWA, etc.), conda
    environments, reference genomes, data provenance with smart checksumming for large files,
    parameter choices, random seeds, and hardware specifications. Generates executable scripts
    with Docker, Singularity, and renv configurations. Integrates with workflow managers
    (Nextflow, Snakemake, WDL, CWL) to ensure complete reproducibility of computational
    research workflows.
